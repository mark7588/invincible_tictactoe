# Invincible Tic-Tac-Toe üéÆ

An unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game powered by the Minimax algorithm. Play against an AI that never loses!

## Features

- ü§ñ **Unbeatable AI**: Uses the Minimax algorithm for perfect play
- üé® **Modern UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a sleek, responsive design
- ‚ö° **Fast & Lightweight**: Pure vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks required
- üì± **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design works on all devices

## Deployment

This application is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

### Automatic Deployment

Every push to the `main` branch automatically triggers a deployment to GitHub Pages. The workflow:

1. Checks out the code
2. Configures GitHub Pages
3. Uploads the static files
4. Deploys to GitHub Pages

### Manual Deployment

You can also trigger a deployment manually:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository
2. Select the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"

### Local Development

To run this application locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mark7588/invincible_tictactoe.git
   cd invincible_tictactoe
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser, or use a local server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## How to Play

1. You are **X** (red), and the AI is **O** (blue)
2. Click on any empty cell to make your move
3. The AI will automatically respond after a short delay
4. Try to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
5. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, so it's unbeatable - your best result is a draw!

## Technology Stack

## Algorithm

The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, a recursive decision-making algorithm that:

1. Explores all possible game states
2. Assigns scores to terminal states (win = +10, loss = -10, draw = 0)
3. Assumes both players play optimally
4. Chooses the move that maximizes the AI's score while minimizing the opponent's

This ensures the AI never loses - it will either win or force a draw.
