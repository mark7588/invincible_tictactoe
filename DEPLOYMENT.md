# Deployment Guide

## Quick Start

After this PR is merged, follow these steps to deploy your application:

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/mark7588/invincible_tictactoe
2. Click on **Settings** (in the top navigation)
3. Scroll down and click on **Pages** (in the left sidebar)
4. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions" from the dropdown
5. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Trigger Deployment

The deployment will automatically happen when:
- You merge this PR to the `main` branch, OR
- You push any changes to the `main` branch

You can also manually trigger deployment:
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click **Run workflow** button
4. Select the `main` branch
5. Click the green **Run workflow** button

### Step 3: Access Your Deployed Application

After the deployment completes (usually takes 1-2 minutes):
- Your application will be live at: **https://mark7588.github.io/invincible_tictactoe/**
- You can find the exact URL in the Actions tab after the deployment succeeds

## What Was Added

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Purpose**: Automatically deploys your static site to GitHub Pages
- **Trigger**: Runs on every push to `main` or manually via workflow_dispatch

### 2. Documentation
- **File**: `README.md`
- **Purpose**: Complete project documentation including:
  - Project description and features
  - Live demo link
  - Deployment instructions
  - Local development guide
  - Technology stack and algorithm explanation

### 3. Git Configuration
- **File**: `.gitignore`
- **Purpose**: Prevents committing unnecessary files (logs, temp files, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for error messages
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
3. Make sure the `main` branch has the latest code
4. Verify repository settings allow GitHub Actions to run

### If the page shows 404:
1. Wait a few minutes after the first deployment
2. Check that GitHub Pages is set to use "GitHub Actions" as source
3. Verify the deployment completed successfully in the Actions tab

## Benefits of This Setup
